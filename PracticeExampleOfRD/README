Why Lambda Expression came in java

Enables functional programming: All new JVM based languages take advantage of the functional paradigm in their 
applications, but programmers forced to work with Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) till lambda expressions came. 

Why Use Joda-Time?
The date/time API, before Java 8, presented multiple design problems.

Among the problems is the fact that the Date and SimpleDateFormatter classes aren't thread-safe. 
To address this issue, Joda-Time uses immutable classes for handling date and time.
The Date class doesn't represent an actual date, but instead,
 it specifies an instant in time, with millisecond precision. The year in a Date starts from 1900,
Joda-Time also offers support for eight calendar systems, 
while Java offers just 2: Gregorian – java.util.GregorianCalendar and Japanese – java.util.JapaneseImperialCalendar.
