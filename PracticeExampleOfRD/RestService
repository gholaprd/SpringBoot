#RESTSERVICE#
 =============
 
 RESTful web services use web protocol i.e. HTTP protocol method. They have the feature like scalability, maintainability, help multiple application 
 communication built on various programming languages, etc.
 The important aspects of this implementation include:

Resources
Request Headers
Request Body
Response Body
Status codes

Name the protocol which is used by RESTful web services.

Answer: RESTful web services use a famous web protocol i.e. HTTP protocol. This serves as a medium of data communication between client and server. 
HTTP standard methods are used to access resources in RESTful web service architecture.


What are the core components of the HTTP request and HTTP response?

Answer: The core components under HTTP Request are:

Verb: Includes methods like GET, PUT, POST, etc.
Uniform Resource Identifier for identifying the resources available on the server.
HTTP Version for specifying the HTTP version.
HTTP Request header for containing the information about the data.
HTTP Request body that contains the representation of the resources in use.
The core components under HTTP Response are:

Request Code: This contains various codes that determine the status of the server response.
HTTP Version for specifying the HTTP version.
HTTP Response header for containing the information about the data.
HTTP Response body that contains the representation of the resources in use.

What is a ‘Resource’?

Answer: Just like the ‘Object’ instance, we have learned in Object Orient Programming Language, in the same way, ‘Resource’ is defined as an object of a 
type which can be an image, HTML file, text data, and any type of dynamic data. There are varieties of representation formats available in order to
 represent a resource.

Some most common Resources are enlisted below:

JSON
YAML
XML
HTML

What is Payload?

Answer: The request data which is present in the body part of every HTTP message is referred to as ‘Payload’.  In Restful web service, the payload can 
only be passed to the recipient through the POST method.

What is the difference between the PUT method and the POST method?

Answer: The major difference between the PUT and POST method is that the result generated with the PUT method is always the same no matter how many times 
the operation is performed. On the other hand, the result generated by POST operation is always different every time.

What HTTP Status Code 200 states?
It means, OK, shows success.

What HTTP Status Code 201 states?
It means, CREATED, when a resource is successful created using POST or PUT request. Return link to newly created resource using location header.

What HTTP Status Code 204 states?
It means, NO CONTENT, when response body is empty for example, a DELETE request.

What HTTP Status Code 304 states?
It means, NOT MODIFIED, used to reduce network bandwidth usage in case of conditional GET requests. Response body should be empty. Headers should have date, location etc.

What HTTP Status Code 400 states?
It means, BAD REQUEST, states that invalid input is provided e.g. validation error, missing data.

What HTTP Status Code 401 states?
It means, FORBIDDEN, states that user is not having access to method being used for example, delete access without admin rights.

What HTTP Status Code 404 states?
It means, NOT FOUND, states that method is not available.

What HTTP Status Code 409 states?
It means, CONFLICT, states conflict situation while executing the method for example, adding duplicate entry.

What is the difference between SOAP and REST web services?
No.	SOAP	REST
1)	SOAP is a protocol.	REST is an architectural style.
2)	SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol.	REST stands for Representational State Transfer.
3)	SOAP can't use REST because it is a protocol.	REST can use SOAP web services because it is a concept and can use any protocol like HTTP, SOAP.
4)	SOAP uses services interfaces to expose the business logic.	REST uses URI to expose business logic.
5)	SOAP defines standards to be strictly followed.	REST does not define too much standards like SOAP.
6)	SOAP permits XML data format only.	REST permits different data format such as Plain text, HTML, XML, JSON.

"PUT" puts a file or resource at a particular URI and exactly at that URI. If there is already a file or resource at that URI, PUT changes that file or 
resource. If there is no resource or file there, PUT makes one

POST sends data to a particular URI and expects the resource at that URI to deal with the request. The web server at this point can decide what to do 
with the data in the context of specified resource

PUT is idempotent meaning, invoking it any number of times will not have an impact on resources.

However, POST is not idempotent, meaning if you invoke POST multiple times it keeps creating more resources

What is the HTTP status return code for a successful DELETE statement? (answer)
There is no strict rule with respect to what status code your REST API should return after a successful DELETE i.e it can return 200 Ok or 204 No Content. 
In general, if the DELETE operation is successful and the response body is empty return 204. If the DELETE request is successful and the 
response body is NOT empty, return 200#RESTSERVICE#
