throw: Sometimes we explicitly want to create exception object and then throw it to halt the normal processing of the program. throw keyword is used to
 throw exception to the runtime to handle it.
 
 Exception is the super class of all checked exceptions whereas RuntimeException is the super class of all unchecked exceptions. 
 Note that RuntimeException is the child class of Exception.
 
 ClassNotFoundException:
An exception that occurs when you try to load a class at run time using Class.forName() or loadClass() methods and mentioned classes are not found in
 the classpath is called ClassNotFoundException.

NoClassDefFoundError:
An exception that occurs when a particular class is present at compile-time but was missing at run time is called NoClassDefFoundError.

hrows keyword is used in method signature to declare which checked exception method can throw, you can also declare unchecked exception, but that is 
not mandatory by the compiler.

This signifies a lot of things like method is not going to handle Exception instead it's throwing it, if method throws checked Exception then the 
caller should provide compile-time exception handling etc.

On the other hand, throw keyword is actually used to throw any Exception. Syntactically you can throw any Throwable (i.e. Throwable or any class 
derived from Throwable) , throw keyword transfers control of execution to the caller so it can be used in place of return keyword. Most common example of 
using throw in place of return is throwing UnSupportedOperationException from an empty method as shown below :

throw																				throws
1)	Java throw keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception.		Java throws keyword is used to declare an exception.
2)	Checked exception cannot be propagated using throw only.			Checked exception can be propagated with throws.
3)	Throw is followed by an instance.									Throws is followed by class.
4)	Throw is used within the method.									Throws is used with the method signature.
5)	You cannot throw multiple exceptions.								You can declare multiple exceptions e.g.
																		public void method()throws IOException,SQLException
